Version 1.0.2 - May 3, 2023
- Now it is possible to pass multiple file paths to the `--hide` (or `-h`) argument.
- Now when using the `--append` option while hiding files, the operation will fail if no existing hidden files can be found. This prevents the existing data from being overwritten in case of a wrong password.
- When an invalid command line option is passed to the program, now the error message says which option was wrong.
- Check if the paths provided by the user are directories, so the program can give the appropriate error message.
